- Hypothesis: "Did a patient’s initial inpatient stay (Initial_days) show an effect on their potential readmissions within our hospital chain?"
- By addressing the hypotheses directly between the chosen independent variables, the outcome should provide a group of patients to focus deeper on in reducing overall patient readmissions.  Through our initial exploratory analysis, the following data was directly compared:
  - If the patient was readmitted
  - If the patient was overweight
  -	The patients’ total charges for their inpatient stay
  -	The initial inpatient stay (in days) 
Analyzing these variables with an Analysis of Variance test (ANOVA), a test comparing the mean of two groups of data sets, i.e. if patients were readmitted or not.  Then, by comparing these independent variables, we were able to see a relation between patient initial stay length which pointed to a higher chance of readmission.
